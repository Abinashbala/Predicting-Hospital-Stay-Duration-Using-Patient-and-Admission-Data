 **Project Title:  Predicting Hospital Stay Duration Using Machine Learning**
 
 • Objective: Built a machine learning model to predict patient hospital stay  duration, optimizing resource 
   allocation in healthcare facilities.

 • Approach:Performed EDA, data cleaning, and feature engineering (handling missing values, scaling). 
   Implemented regression models (Linear Regression, XGBoost), fine-tuned hyperparameters using 
   GridSearchCV, and evaluated with RMSE.
 • Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib.
 
 • Results: Achieved a 12% improvement in accuracy with an RMSE of 0.35 days using the XGBoost model.
